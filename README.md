# kmonitor

This is an effort to reimplement ps, lsof and netstat as a Linux kernel module.
:warning: I'm far from being an expert in Linux kernel. This module is not stable yet and you may want to try it inside a virtual machine to not crash your system. 

# TODO 

- [x] First tour of related kernel data structures
- [ ] Improve networking part
- [ ] Create entry in procfs
- [ ] Write documentation
